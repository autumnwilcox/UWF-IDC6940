### Summary
This paper provides an introduction to Bayesian linear regression within the context of clinical data analysis. It contrasts Bayesian methodologies with traditional frequentist methods, highlighting the limitations of the latter, particularly in relation to **p-values** and **confidence intervals**. The article explains fundamental Bayesian concepts such as **priors**, **likelihood**, and **posterior distributions**. It presents an example using **electroencephalogram (EEG)** and **anxiety study data** to demonstrate the relationship between **error-related negativity (ERN)** and **trait anxiety**. It also covers practical aspects like **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** sampling, assessing **model convergence**, interpreting **credible intervals**, and evaluating **model fit** using **WAIC** and **LOO-CV**, extending the discussion to other models like **logistic** and **Poisson regression**.

### What is the goal of the paper?
The goal of the paper is to introduce Bayesian linear regression techniques to researchers in clinical psychology and related fields, demonstrating how these methods can provide more informative and nuanced insights compared to traditional frequentist approaches.

### What is the problem being addressed?
The problem being addressed is the limitations of frequentist statistical methods, particularly the reliance on p-values and confidence intervals, which can lead to misinterpretations and less informative results in clinical data analysis.
### Why is it important?
It is important because clinical data often involve complexities such as small sample sizes, missing data, and hierarchical structures that traditional methods may not handle well. Bayesian methods offer a more flexible and robust framework for analyzing such data, leading to better-informed clinical decisions and research outcomes.
### What are the key results?
Key results include a detailed explanation of Bayesian linear regression concepts, a practical example using EEG and anxiety data, and guidance on implementing Bayesian methods using software like R and Stan. The paper also discusses how to assess model convergence and fit, providing a comprehensive overview of Bayesian analysis in a clinical context.
### What are the limitations of the paper?
Limitations of the paper include its focus on linear regression, which may not cover all types of clinical data analysis needs.
