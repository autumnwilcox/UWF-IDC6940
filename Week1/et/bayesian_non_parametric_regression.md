# Bayesian Nonparametric Regression for Healthcare Claims Modeling
Richardson, R., & Hartman, B. (2018). Bayesian nonparametric regression models for modeling and predicting healthcare claims. Insurance, Mathematics & Economics, 79, 1-13.

# Summary

This paper introduces Bayesian nonparametric regression models to effectively model and predict healthcare claims data, which often exhibit complex characteristics such as skewness, heavy tails, and excess zeros. The authors propose using Dirichlet process mixtures to flexibly capture the underlying distribution of healthcare claims without assuming a specific parametric form. The models are designed to handle the unique features of healthcare claims data, including the presence of many zero claims (non-claimants) and the variability in claim amounts among claimants.

The authors apply their models to a real-world dataset of healthcare claims, demonstrating the models' ability to accurately predict claim amounts and identify high-risk individuals. The Bayesian framework allows for the incorporation of prior information and provides a coherent way to quantify uncertainty in predictions. The results show that the proposed nonparametric regression models outperform traditional parametric models in terms of predictive accuracy and flexibility.

# Problem
- Standard regression limitations
    - Insufficient for complex relationships in healthcare claims data
    - Assumes Gaussianity, independence, linearity
    - Assumptions often not met in insurance data
    - Difficulty in capturing skewness, heavy tails, outliers, and bimodality present in claims data

# Solution
- Bayesian nonparametric regression models
    - Flexible regression model
    - Relaxes Normality and linearity assumptions
    - Poweful tool for non-Gaussian densities
    - Increased predictive accuracy
    - Handles complex error distribution characteristics
    - Applicable to all insurance regression problems

# Methodology
- Dependent Dirichlet Process (DDP) ANOVA Model
    - Dirichlet Process (DP)  (3.1)
      - Standard building block for Bayesian nonparametric models
      - Constructed via stick-breaking process
      - Discrete distribution with countably infinite atoms
      - DP mixture of normals for continuous settings
      - Allows for infinite mixture models
    - DDP (3.2)
      - Basis for fully nonparametric regression model
      - Prior on space of random probability measures
      - Point masses are realizations of stochastic processes
      - Infinite mixture of Gaussian processes
    - DDP ANOVA model (3.3)
      - Extends DDP to include covariate information
      - Atoms are regression coefficients and covariance
      - Flexible relationships and error structure
      - Uses Gibbs sampling for posterior inference

# Application
- Healthcare claims by ETG
    - Dataset: Episode Treatment Groups (ETG) from a large health insurer
    - ETG
      - Classification system for medical conditions
      - Predicts healthcare costs
      - Uncertainty in cost predictions is important
    - Covariates
      - age, gender, healthcare charges
    - Focus on prediction of new observations

# Results and performance
- Outperforms standard linear model
- Outperforms Generalized Beta 2 (GB2) regression (all but 11 of 347 ETGs)
- Better predictive accuracy
- DIC (Deviance Information Criterion) consistently lower for BNP
- Lower averarge CRPS for out-of-sample predictions
- Accurately captures tail behavior (useful for reserving/risk assessment)

# Case studies
- Conjunctivitis
  - Large dataset (160,000+ observations)
  - Distribution is highly non-Gaussian, bimodal
  - BNP captures gender effect, standard models fail
  - Lowest DIC (10,600 vs 12,600 for BLM and 12,300 for GB2)
  - Accurately predicts extra mode in left tail
- Lung transplant
  - Smaller dataset 
  - Data skewed, Gaussian assumption inappropriate
  - BNP/GB2 predict thicker tail for outliers
  - GB2 slightly better DIC (1002 vs 1005 for BNP, and 1080 for BLM)
  - Less advantage from flexible models in smaller datasets


# Limitations
- BNP more computationally intensive than standard linear regression
- But BNP regression scales at the same reate as linear regression

# Conclusion
- Powerful tool for healthcare claims modeling
- Vastly outperforms linear and GB2 regression
- Useful for reserving due to improved distributional fit
- DDP ANOVA useful for continuous independent variables
- Can be extended(e.g. covariate-dependent weights)
- Available in R package `DPpackage`
